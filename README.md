# MultiscaleModelling
The aim of the project was to implement grain growth algorithms for Multiscale Modelling course. 
Simple grain growth was implemented by using Cellular Automata method. Cells have clearly defined interaction rules between each other.
Project was implemented in Java using NetBeans IDE 8.2.
